#    summary: |
#      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

I am a dual-title Ph.D. candidate in Political Science and Social Data Analytics at Pennsylvania State University, where I expect to defend my dissertation in Spring 2026. My substantive research interest focuses on everyday resistance in authoritarian regimes. Methodologically, I am interested in text-as-data, network analysis, interviews in sensitive contexts, and survey experiments. While I have published and working papers in cross-national and democratic contexts, I have regional expertise in China. My work is forthcoming on _Social Media + Society_.
